       The Computer Vision Technology team, with computer vision technology at its core, focuses on the research and development and application research of omnidirectional vision sensors, multi-source information fusion visualization, and intelligent image analysis. In the field of omnidirectional vision sensors, through stitching and fusion technology, a variety of omnidirectional vision sensors have been developed to achieve ultra-long distance and ultra-high-definition video image monitoring of large scenes. At the same time, based on panoramic video, combined with tilt measurement, multi-source information matching fusion and other technologies, research on multi-scale dynamic virtual reality fusion, multi-source heterogeneous data mining and intelligent analysis, AR three-dimensional presentation algorithm is conducted. In addition, in the field of intelligent image analysis, the main focus is on the research of artificial intelligence recognition and analysis technology for small sample, weak difference, and multi-category complex scenes. The team has undertaken key projects such as the National Science and Technology Support Plan, the Chinese Academy of Sciences STS Project, the 863 Plan, provincial and municipal level projects, and several technical commissioned development projects. There are currently 20 full-time employees and 30 graduate students.
